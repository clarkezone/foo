## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/clarkezone/foo/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

[goto page2](page2)

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```cs
            // Grab the compositor for the window
            compositor = Window.Current.Compositor;

            // Create a new ShapeVisual that will contain our drawings
            Windows.UI.Composition.ShapeVisual shape = compositor.CreateShapeVisual();

            // set this as a child of our host shape from XAML
            ElementCompositionPreview.SetElementChildVisual(VectorHost, shape);
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/clarkezone/foo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
